Summary: Nothing OS-style home screen widget manager
Description: |-
    Widget App is a local-first Android home screen widget manager
    built with Flutter and inspired by the Nothing OS design language.

    Features:
    * Digital dot-matrix clock widget
    * Battery level indicator with custom painter
    * Quick note widget — edit text and push it to your home screen
    * Widget Bridge: control your home screen widget title, subtitle
      and counter directly from within the app
    * Bidirectional sync: tap the + button on the home screen widget
      itself to increment the counter without opening the app
    * Pure black Nothing OS theme — zero elevation, 1 dp borders
    * Riverpod state management, SharedPreferences persistence
    * No trackers, no analytics, no remote servers
