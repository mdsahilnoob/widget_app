Summary: Nothing OS-style home screen widget manager
Description: |-
    Widget App is a local-first Android home screen widget manager
    built with Flutter, inspired by the Nothing OS design language.

    Features:
    * Digital dot-matrix clock widget
    * Battery level indicator with custom painter
    * Quick note widget — edit text and push it to your home screen
    * Widget Bridge: control title, subtitle and counter on the home
      screen widget directly from within the app
    * Bidirectional counter: tap + on the home screen widget to
      increment it without opening the app
    * Pure black Nothing OS theme — zero elevation, 1 dp borders
    * Riverpod state management, SharedPreferences persistence
    * No trackers, no analytics, no remote servers
